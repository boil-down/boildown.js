Indentation for listings: If a line starts with 2 (or more) spaces it is nested.
2 spaces are cut off. This allows use of 2 or 3 spaces for 1 level on indentation
as a 3rd will leave just 1 space at the beginning what has no spacial meaning.

Write options lile `[java][59][<>]`
if option starts with a letter we add a class like `java` (no prefix for full user control)
if option is numeric, we add `width=59%`
